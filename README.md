## My Predictions* <a class="anchor" id="predict"></a>
###### *This section of the README is based on my personal observations and opinons. "Numerical Expectations" is rooted in numerical predictions based on actual data trends. 

So here's the deal... I am expecting this experiment to fail. I'm actually trying to prove that the forecasting is inaccurate because mass media consumption trends changed with the introduction of the pandemic and TikTok. 

The data is between the years 2010-2019. The concept of viral sounds existed long before 2020-- if you're a millenial/gen z, you probably still quote Vines on the regular. However, the introduction of TikTok allowed for the capture of viral sounds independently from the videos they originated from. TikTok has an incredibly vast reach, finding its way into most other social/consumer medias, from reels on Instagram to Spotify generated playlist of the top songs on TikTok. The platform introduced a popularization of independent and 'throwback' (anything before 2015-ish) music to mainstream consumers. As the mainstream continues to diversify, trends may become more difficult to predict because the data will continue to be more widespread.

Side note: This ties into the idea that "genre" is a dying concept. Diversification of music means less ways to define differences across musics types.

It is important to create an expected output because it will help us gauage if our actual output is reasonable. We are rooting our intuition in what we logically expect to happen.
